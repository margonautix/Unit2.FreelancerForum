# Unit2.FreelancerForum

Was able to create different arrays for names, prices, and occupations to be randomly pulled from and put together in new table rows in 1 second increments.

Currently stuck on getting the average of those prices, updating it in real time, and displaying it on the page...

update: used .reduce to get sum of freelancer.price and divided by length of array to get average, then innerHTML to add it to the page. success!
